# code_challenge

This is a whiteboard coding challenge that I received recently. The task is to sort a given array so that
certain element is located at predetermined points in the array and then return that array. 

# set up
There are three input variables for this problem:
  * element n which appear randomly in the unsorted array *suggested*
  * index - an array of integers that designate at which index each element n needs to occupy in the suggested array
  * suggested - the unsorted array of objects which includes both the elements n and the other objects

# assumptions
 For purposes of this problem, you may assume that the number of n elements in the unsorted array is equal to len(index). 
 In other words, you don't need to worry about cases where there are too many n elements in the suggested array or not enough
 Also, the correct solution will minimize disruption to the unsorted array suggested. Move elements around as least as possible.
